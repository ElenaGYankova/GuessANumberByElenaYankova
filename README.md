"Guess A Number" is a game in which your opponent (the computer), chooses a random number between "1 and 100", and your task is to guess this number. After each number you enter, the computer will give you a hint of whether the number is greater or less than the number you selected until you guess the correct number. You will have 7 attempts and if you do not guess the number of you will loose the game.
